# AWS Identity Center — Airline Identity Setup

This section establishes identity-first access for the Airline Identity Risk Lab
using AWS Identity Center (SSO).

## Design Principles
- No IAM users
- Role-based access only
- Read-only by default
- Safe for demo and screenshots

## Identity Types Modeled
- Passenger
- Airline Agent
- Airline Security Analyst

These identities represent real airline personas without using production data.
